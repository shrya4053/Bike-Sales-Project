    - Adults (not Seniors) are the main group buying bikes (50.2%)
    - People who buy bikes have a higher average salary than those who don't.
    - Customers who own zero cars have the highest buying rate (61.1%).

  ## Final Conclusion
  - Direct all local advertising to residential areas and office buildings within a 5-mile radius of the store. (Solves the Distance problem).
  - Run promotions that emphasize time savings and avoiding traffic. This appeals to the Adult customer with a good salary.
  - Feature premium, durable commuter bikes and accessories instead of entry-level mountain bikes. SInce the buyer has a higher average salary, confirming they can afford a quality product.
  - Adults are the primary buyers (50.2% Buy Rate). The store should focus its demographic targeting here.
