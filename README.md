# Bike-Sales-Project (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
Analysis of bike buyers to identify key sales predictors. Found that short commutes (0-5 mi), higher income, and the Adult age bracket drive the highest purchase rates, providing actionable intelligence for targeted marketing campaigns.
## Project Objective
To study all the customer details (like age, income, and where they live) to find out exactly what kind of people buy bikes the most. We will use this information to give the store a simple plan for who to target and where to put their ads, so they can sell more bikes and grow the business faster
